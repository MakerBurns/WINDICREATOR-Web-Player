Wind I Creator Text Related

---------------------------
Translator's Memo
---------------------------

I am including this document in the release of this
fine VIPRPG for a few reasons:
>Anyone who wants to TL this to a different language
 later can benefit from some of this being printed
 out here rather than having to pore over the images
 in the pictures folder for hours and hours
>Lots of useful TL notes scattered all around
>A few sections which detail my thought process on
 the script translation itself. You will see it is
 a rather iterative process.

Kiito's games are never easy to translate because of
the sheer workload of getting, and adapting, the
text images to English while making sure everything
stays consistent and that any compromises or adjustments
that must be made are done with purpose rather than
serving as a bandaid.

Some changes to the game's event code were necessary as
a matter of course due to the differences between the
EN/JP pair. In addition, careful word choice and font
selection were required to ensure that the full meaning
of the text was conveyed, while simultaneously fitting
into the often limited space available.

I try not to make drastic changes to the interface if it
can be avoided. For example, the item/skill description
boxes are the same dimensions as the JP originals.
However, certain things like the attack selections
were modified slightly to accommodate the greater amount
of English text required. However, these edits were made
tastefully as to preserve the original feel and presentation
of the game in the Japanese.

Originally, some of the effect/status text pops were done
in what seems to be a purely handwritten font. I opted NOT
do do the same in English and selected a familiar brush
script font for the sake of aesthetics and consistency.

Overall, the script itself is not that large and therefore
I have been able to give it the sort of care I feel it
deserves. Translating a VIPRPG is not a task to take
lightly as you should have sufficient background in, and
have played, a variety of VIPRPGs from several makers,
including any other titles produced by the maker of the
work you intend to TL. I feel that this allows you to get
into the head of the creator a bit and understand certain
recurring things, habits, word choice, and so forth, that
might set theirs apart from others.

Status Effect Icons stuff


There is NO GOOD WAY to do these without serious
compromise. Japanese is unfair sometimes. Reworked
the icons from 12x12 squares to weird 12x6 rectangles
to fit in more descriptive versions of the statuses.

To Do: confirm these remaining status effect icons

EX8 = 解 = limitbreaker
EX11 = ボ = THIS WAY, no clue why it's "bo" here but meh
EX12 = 立 = Beeline
EX16 = 憤 = Anger (not sure if this is distinctly separate in
                   effect from 怒 but it exists, so...)


---------------------------
GAME OVER SCRIPT
---------------------------

Debating how to deal with the game over script.
4行 is how it is originally presented, with each
line appearing one after the other with the
passing of each text box, but I feel it doesn't
do the script justice to truncate it so it fits
there. Breaking it up into 2 separate text
boxes to allow more text is probably a safe
compromise and allows for a more accurate
presentation of the dialogue.

Take care not to make the English rendering read
TOO poetically, however tempting that may seem.

\>　その日、ウィンドⅠは静かに息を引き取った
\>　寿命で死んだ生き物は二度と蘇生できない
\>　さよなら、ウィンドⅠ
\>　来世では、元気な体で生まれるといいね

4line version
(cuts: mention of her dying peacefully, mention of
 "this way" referring to her natural lifespan
 running out, slight mod to the final line which
 more literally feels like "I hope that you are
 born unto a healthier body in the next life."
 "Creatures"/"Living things" reduced to the less
 descriptive "those." SOMEONE is gonna get pissed
 that I did not interpret 来世 as "afterlife" but
 imo the implication that one will be born unto
 a body says to me that a different interpretation
 is rather appropriate.)

...So yeah, definitely worth modifying this.
 
\> Wind I took her last breath that day.
\> Those whose life ends this way can't be revived.
\> Farewell, Wind I.
\> I hope you are born healthier in the next life.
 
 Wind I took her last breath that day.
 Those whose life force expires can't be revived.
 Farewell, Wind I.
 May you be blessed with a healthier body in the next life.
//Too big. Maybe just use "all" the space instead
  of using each line individually? Want to retain
  the original impact of the presentation...

 Wind I took her last breath that day, and passed
 away peacefully.
 Creatures whose life force expires naturally like
 this cannot be revived.

 Farewell, Wind I.
 
 I hope that a healthier body awaits you in the
 next life.

Most likely final version: 

***
\> Wind I took her last breath that day, and passed
\> away peacefully.


***
\> Wind I took her last breath that day, and passed
\> away peacefully. Creatures whose natural
\> life force expires cannot be resurrected.

***
\> Farewell, Wind I.
 
 

*** 
\> Farewell, Wind I.
\>
\> I hope that a healthier body awaits you in the
\> next life.
